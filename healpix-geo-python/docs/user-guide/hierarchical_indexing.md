# Hierarchical Indexing and Neighbours

This chapter explains the hierarchical structure of HEALPix.

Sibling, parent, and neighbours cells.
```

## Neighbours

First, let us recall that on the HEALPix grid there are 8 points on the globe where three cells meet at the same vertex (instead of the usual four).
This means for each corner there are three cells that only have 7 immediate neighbours (instead of 8).
The functions presented here will always return arrays of the same size.

:::{important}
If a cell has less neighbours than the maximum, the result will be padded with `-1`.

This means that, even though the functions are returning cell indices, the result will be a {py:attr}`numpy.int64` signed integer array instead of the usual unsigned {py:attr}`numpy.uint64`.

Example of a "corner".

The highlighted cell has only 7 immediate neighbours.
```

Functions retrieving neighbouring cells take in a `ring` parameter that specifies the target degree of connectivity:
- `ring=1` for the 8 immediate neighbours
- `ring=2` for the 16 neighbours of the immediate neighbours
- ...

They are two families of functions available.
{py:func}`~healpix_geo.auto.kth_neighbours` will return the cells in the specified ring, *ie* in the border of the neighborhood. This means 8 cells for `ring=1`, 16 cells for `ring=2`, ...

{py:func}`~healpix_geo.auto.kth_neighbourhood` will return all the cells inside the neighborhood, including the input, center cell. This means 9 cells for `ring=1`, 25 cells for `ring=2`, ...

```
Finally, for a finer control on what neighbouring cells to retrieve, {py:func}`healpix_geo.nested.neighbours` can return in a fixed order either:
- the 4 cells that share an edge (SW, NW, NE, SE),
- the 4 cells that share a vertex, but not an edge (S, W, N, E)
- the 8 immediate neighbours (clockwise starting from S).

## Hierarchical Navigation

:::{note}
This section is only relevant for the `nested` indexing scheme.
:::

To raise the refinement level by one, each cell is subdivided in 4. The original cell is the **parent** and the 4 children are **siblings** of each other.
See [](#indexing-schemes) for details on the indices of those cells.

To obtain the siblings of given cells, one can use {py:func}`healpix_geo.nested.siblings`.
For instance:
```{code-cell} python
healpix_geo.nested.siblings(0, depth=1)
```

The {py:func}`healpix_geo.nested.zoom_to` function allows to move up and down the cell hierarchy. It takes the current level and a target level.

When targeting a higher level (target level > current level), the function will give all descendants of each input cell. For instance:
```{code-cell} python
healpix_geo.nested.zoom_to(0, depth=0, new_depth=2)
```

When targeting a lower level (target level < current level), the function will give the parent of each input cell. For instance:
```{code-cell} python
healpix_geo.nested.zoom_to(12, depth=2, new_depth=0)
```
