# HEALPix fundamentals and indexing schemes

## Overview

HEALPix (Hierarchical Equal-Area isoLatitude Pixelisation) was originally defined for use in astronomy by [Gorski et al. (2005)](#gorski-2005). It has several important properties:

- **equal area**: all cells of the same refinement level have exactly the same area
- **iso-latitude**: all cells of the same refinement level are arranged around rings of the same latitude
- **hierarchical**: cells are created by recursively and evenly subdividing, which forms a hierarchy of cells

```

The lowest refinement level (0) has 12 'base' cells. To go to a higher resolution, each cell is subdivided into 4 'children' cells (they are 'siblings', the original cell is the 'parent').
This makes up- and down-sampling operations trivial.
This means that for a given level, there are $12\cdot4^{\mathrm{level}}$ cells.
The refinement level can go up to 29, where cells have a side-length of approximately 1cm.

To keep compatibility with some other HEALPix libraries, some functions of this package may refer to the refinement level as "depth".

## Indexing schemes

At a given refinement level, each cell has a unique identifier, or 'index'. There are multiple *indexing schemes* that sort cells differently. 
This is an important consideration as cells that have neighbouring indices will also be close in memory (when the data is sorted).

- `ring`, where indices of cells on the same iso-latitude rings are close to each other.
- `nested`, where indices of sibling cells are close to each other. 

Based on `nested`, there are two more schemes that also encode the refinement level in the cell id, which is useful for MOC (Multi-Order Coverage):

- `nuniq`, which represents all cells in the hierarchy breadth-first, i.e. cells of a refinement level are close numerically. This is not currently supported by `healpix-geo`.
- `zuniq`, which represents all cells in the hierarchy depth-first, i.e. descendant cells of a given cell are close numerically.

### Z-ordering

`nested` and `zuniq` indexing schemes are following a Z-order (aka Morton order).

See that to obtain the parent of a cell, one can just bit-shift by 2 bits to the right.
For instance, siblings cells {0, 1, 2, 3} have a parent cell of index 0 (corresponding to a lower refinement level by one).

### Choosing a scheme

For most usages, `nested` is the recommended scheme, though others can be appropriate in some situations:
| Need                    | Recommended Scheme |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ |
| General Application     | **nested**         |
| Hierarchical Navigation | **nested**         |
| Spherical harmonics     | **ring**           |
| Order by latitude       | **ring**           |
| MOC                     | **zuniq**          |

`healpix-geo` provides a module for each indexing scheme
({py:mod}`~healpix_geo.nested`, {py:mod}`~healpix_geo.ring`,
{py:mod}`~healpix_geo.zuniq`) however it is recommended to use functions from the
{py:mod}`~healpix_geo.auto` module which will automatically dispatch to the
correct module. The indexing scheme, refinement level and ellipsoidal model is passed through a {py:class}`~healpix_geo.auto.Grid` object:

```python
import healpix_geo.auto

grid = healpix_geo.auto.Grid(level=8, indexing_scheme="nested", ellispoid="WGS84")
lon, lat = healpix_geo.auto.healpix_to_lonlat(cell_ids, grid)
```

Each module provides functions to convert indices **from** the module indexing scheme to another one. For instance to change from `ring` to `nested`:
```python
cell_ids_nested = healpix_geo.ring.to_nested(cell_ids_ring, depth=8)
```
Or you can use {py:func}`healpix_geo.auto.convert` to convert between any schemes.

:::{important}
Those conversion functions will change the values of indices, but your data will stay in the same order. If necessary, remember to sort your data by indices.
